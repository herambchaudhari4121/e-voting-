### E-VOTING With Blockchain

## **Workflow for Your eVoting System**

1. **User Onboarding**:
    - **Sign-Up Page (`/signup`)**:
        - New users register by providing the required details.
        - After successful sign-up, navigate them to the login page (`/login`).
        - You can enhance this with email verification or reCAPTCHA for security.
    - **Login Page (`/login`)**:
        - Users log in with their credentials.
        - After successful login, redirect to the Election Selection page (`/election-selection`).
        - Consider adding JWT or session management for secure authentication.

---

1. **Voting Process**:
    - **Election Selection Page (`/election-selection`)**:
        - Display a list of active elections.
        - Allow the user to select an election and press the "Vote Now" button.
        - On clicking "Vote Now," set the `currentElection` state and navigate to the Voting page (`/voting`).
    - **Voting Page (`/voting`)**:
        - Display the list of candidates for the selected election.
        - Allow the user to cast a vote.
        - After vote submission, generate a mock or real transaction hash and navigate to the Vote Confirmation page (`/confirmation`).
    - **Vote Confirmation Page (`/confirmation`)**:
        - Show the transaction hash to confirm vote submission.
        - Provide a button to return to the dashboard (Election Selection Page or Voter History Page).

---

1. **Post-Voting Options**:
    - **Voter History Page (`/history`)**:
        - Allow users to view a history of their previous votes (election ID, date, and transaction hash).
        - Add a button to return to the Election Selection Page.

---

1. **Default Route**:
    - **Redirect (`/`)**:
        - Redirect users to the `/signup` page by default if no valid route is accessed.
        - If authentication is implemented, you can check if the user is logged in and route them to their dashboard directly.

---

### **Suggestions for Workflow Improvements**

1. **Authentication Flow**:
    - Implement authentication using JWT or sessions for login and persist user state across pages.
    - Redirect logged-in users to `/election-selection` if they try to access `/signup` or `/login`.
2. **Error Handling**:
    - Add a **404 Error Page** for invalid routes.
    - Display error messages for invalid login credentials or sign-up attempts.
3. **State Management**:
    - Use a global state management library like Redux or Context API to handle user authentication and election data.
    - This will make state transitions between components more efficient.
4. **Enhanced Voting Features**:
    - **Timer for Elections**: Add a countdown timer for voting deadlines.
    - **Confirmation Prompt**: Show a modal to confirm the user’s choice before submitting their vote.
    - **Blockchain Integration**: Replace the mock transaction hash with real blockchain integration if you plan to implement this.
5. **Improved Navigation**:
    - Use a navigation bar or sidebar for easy access to pages like Voter History and Logout.
    - Include a "Logout" button to clear user authentication state.
6. **Accessibility**:
    - Ensure all components are keyboard and screen-reader friendly.
    - Provide visual feedback for actions (e.g., loading spinners for vote submission).
7. **Testing**:
    - Test workflows extensively with tools like Jest and React Testing Library.
    - Ensure the voting process is secure and error-free.

### **Blockchain Integration Flow for eVoting System**

1. **Election Creation** (Admin-Side Process):
    - Store election metadata (e.g., election ID, name, candidates, and start/end times) on the blockchain.
    - Use a smart contract to manage the election process, such as defining candidates and verifying election statuses.
    
    **Implementation**:
    
    - Deploy a smart contract for each election or a single contract to manage multiple elections.
    - Store election details on the blockchain as events or mappings.

---

1. **User Registration**:
    - After the sign-up process, verify voter identity and issue a unique blockchain-based voter ID or key.
    - Store voter eligibility or registration status in the blockchain.
    
    **Implementation**:
    
    - Use a smart contract to validate voter eligibility.
    - Generate cryptographic keys (e.g., public/private keys) for secure interaction with the blockchain.

---

1. **Election Selection**:
    - Fetch available elections dynamically from the blockchain.
    - Ensure the current election's status (active/inactive) is verified directly via the blockchain.
    
    **Implementation**:
    
    - Use a smart contract function to retrieve all active elections and their details.

---

1. **Voting Process**:
    - When a voter casts their vote, record it on the blockchain by interacting with the smart contract.
    - The vote should be stored anonymously to ensure privacy while maintaining transparency.
    
    **Implementation**:
    
    - Call the smart contract’s `castVote` function with parameters like voter ID and candidate ID.
    - Use the voter's private key to sign the transaction for authenticity.
    - Ensure each voter can vote only once by adding a validation mechanism (e.g., marking the voter as "voted" on the blockchain).

---

1. **Vote Confirmation**:
    - After a vote is cast, display the transaction hash generated by the blockchain to confirm successful submission.
    - Allow users to track their vote using this hash.
    
    **Implementation**:
    
    - Fetch the transaction receipt and display the hash and other details (e.g., gas used, block number).

---

1. **Vote Counting**:
    - Count votes in real-time by querying the blockchain.
    - Use the smart contract to tally votes securely and prevent tampering.
    
    **Implementation**:
    
    - Add a `countVotes` function in the smart contract to calculate votes for each candidate.
    - Make vote counts viewable in real-time or only after the election ends, depending on the requirements.
  
    - 1. **Voter History**:
    - Fetch previous elections and voting history for the voter from the blockchain.
    - Provide proof of participation for transparency.
    
    **Implementation**:
    
    - Query the blockchain for events associated with the voter ID.
    - Display the election details and transaction hashes for each vote.

---

1. **Admin Dashboard**:
    - Allow admins to monitor election statuses, create new elections, and fetch results.
    - Use blockchain data to ensure tamper-proof records.
    
    **Implementation**:
    
    - Use the blockchain for storing and retrieving election results.
    - Provide admin-only access to certain smart contract functions, secured with role-based permissions.

---

### **Blockchain Tools & Frameworks**

- **Smart Contract Development**: Use **Solidity** or **Vyper** to create smart contracts.
- **Blockchain Platform**: Deploy your application on Ethereum, Polygon, or Hyperledger.
- **Web3 Integration**:
    - Use libraries like **ethers.js** or **web3.js** for interacting with the blockchain.
    - Integrate Metamask or another wallet for users to sign transactions.

---

### **Workflow with Blockchain**:

1. User signs up and is assigned a unique voter ID (linked to blockchain).
2. Voter logs in and views active elections fetched from the blockchain.
3. Voter selects an election, views candidates, and casts their vote.
4. The vote is recorded on the blockchain via a smart contract.
5. Transaction hash is displayed as proof of vote submission.
6. Results are tallied directly from the blockchain, ensuring transparency.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
